The study defines the baseline (1000), 6 month (1060) and 12 month (1120) visits. Once a study visit is complete, any number of interim visits are accepted until the lower bound of the next study defined visit is reached. Interim attendance may be for routine care, drug-refills or unwell visits. The EDC enforces these boundaries. Boundaries are calculated relative to baseline.

Visit	Lower bound from baseline	Upper bound from baseline
Baseline	0	0
6 month	>= 5 months	< 8 months
12 month	>= 8 months	<= 15 months

At baseline, details of qualifying chronic condition are reported. Additional baseline chronic conditions may also be reported for those with co-morbidities. New diagnoses are queried for at all post-baseline visits, study defined or interim, and reported on in detail. New diagnoses are reported on initially in detail using a condition-specific CRF:
HivInitialReview (hiv_dx: yes/no)
DmInitialReview (dm_dx: yes/no)
HtnInitialReview (htn_dx: yes/no)
Once a diagnosis is reported, a review of the condition and any medications received is required:
HivReview, HivDrugRefill (if on medication)
DmReview, DmDrugRefill (if on medication)
HtnReview, HtnDrugRefill (if on medication)
Each visit starts with a clinical review that queries for any new diagnoses.
